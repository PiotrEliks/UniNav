## üìù About the Project

The aim of this project is to develop both a **mobile application** and an **interactive website** to assist users in navigating through the **Faculty of Physics at Adam Mickiewicz University**. By utilizing **Augmented Reality (AR)**, QR codes, and responsive web design, the project enhances navigation within the faculty building and provides a seamless experience for users both on-site and remotely.

Our solution focuses on making the faculty more accessible for everyone, including individuals with disabilities, by providing multiple navigation tools and features.

### üì± Mobile Application
The mobile app leverages **AR technology** using the **Unity 3D engine**. By scanning existing QR codes placed throughout the Faculty, users can receive real-time navigation assistance. The integration of **AR Foundation** (compatible with **ARCore**) enables a smooth interaction between the physical space and virtual navigation tools.

### üåê Website
The website is developed with **React** and features a **responsive interactive map** of the Faculty. This map allows users to plan their routes before entering the building, taking into account factors such as accessibility options for people with disabilities. The website makes it easy to locate rooms, offices, and key facilities.

### ‚ôø Accessibility Features
- **3D-printed tactile maps**: For visually impaired individuals, we are creating 3D-printed maps of the Faculty, with **Braille** labels and tactile features, allowing them to navigate the building independently.
- **Accessible route planning**: Both the mobile app and website consider accessibility factors such as step-free routes and features designed for people with limited mobility.

## üöÄ Project Goals
In today's fast-paced technological landscape, academic spaces should adapt to the needs of modern users. This project not only delivers innovative tools but also emphasizes the importance of creating **inclusive environments** that cater to everyone.

Our objectives:
- **Enhance accessibility** to the Faculty with AR navigation.
- Provide a user-friendly web interface for **pre-arrival planning**.
- Ensure the platform is **inclusive**, offering tools for individuals with disabilities.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Unity 3D**: For building the AR-powered mobile application.
- **AR Foundation**: To support AR functionality on mobile devices.
- **React**: For the responsive and interactive website.
- **3D Printing**: To create tactile maps for visually impaired users.


## üìä Market Trends
The trend of integrating navigation apps and systems on university campuses is growing. For example, **Warsaw University of Technology** has introduced **PW Navi** and **PW Mapa**, which help students locate lecture halls and other facilities using Bluetooth and GNSS technology. Our project aims to bring similar benefits to Adam Mickiewicz University while also focusing on accessibility.
